My goal is to implement due date tracker component to embed on any flask web app to run smoothly.
this must be fully custermizerble with python.
if someone need to use this, what he need to do is,
1.  clone the repo
2.  put the calander.py file in to the project folder.
3.  impoert calander.py in to the app.py and make a object.
4.  pass the parameters for the load_calander function.
5.  make a html tag with named calander or somethong on index.html file
